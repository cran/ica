Changes from ver 1.0-2 to ver 1.0-3     [July-08-2022]
   1) Computational improvements for n < p
	*   Now computes initial PCA using eigen of X %*% t(X) if n < p
	*   Applies to all ICA functions (fast, imax, and jade)
   2) Added "ica" wrapper function
	*   Can be used to fit ICA model via FastICA, Infomax, or JADE
	*   The "method" argument controls the decomposition method
   3) Added "converged" output to all ICA functions
	*   converged = TRUE if algorithm converged (w.r.t. user-specified tol)
	*   converged = FALSE if maximum number of iterations (maxit) is reached
   4) Added classes and print method for all ICA functions
	*   Outputs are now of class "icafast", "icaimax", or "icajade"
	*   Print method prints basic details about model fit and algorithm



Changes from ver 1.0-1 to ver 1.0-2     [May-24-2018]
   1) ica-package
	*   Package file is now update-to-date with Description file
	*   Updated references throughout
	*   Remove "congru" function from package
   2) congru
	*   Removed function from package
	*   See "multiway" package for a duplicate of congru



Changes from ver 1.0-0 to ver 1.0-1     [Aug-24-2015]
   1) ica-package
	*   Improvements and updates to internals of all functions
	*   Changed "acyidx" to "acy"
	*   Major changes to congru functionality (for matrices)
	*   Bug fix for icafast with alpha != 1
   2) acy (acyidx)
	*   Changed function name from "acyidx" to "acy"
	*   Minor updates to help file and internals
   3) congru
	*   Change in default behavior if "x" and "y" are matrices
	*   Now comparable to "cor" and "cov" functions
	*   Calculates congruence coefficient matrices
   4) icafast
	*   Bug fix for alpha inputs not equal to 1
